# Incorrect Geolocation in Google Services

Some customers have reported that Google incorrectly identifies their virtual server IP address as originating from a different country than where the server is actually located. We explain the reasons behind this and how you can fix this.

## How to diagnose this issue

To check if you're experiencing this problem:

1. Open Google's home page in your browser's incognito mode (you must be connected to the VPN located on your server)
2. Look at the country displayed at the bottom of the page

If you see "Germany" or "Deutschland", Google is correctly reporting your server's location.

If you see a different country, Google has overridden our officially registered location data with their own inaccurate information.

## Why this happens

Google's geolocation system relies on multiple data sources to determine an IP address location:

1. **Official IP registry data** - The location we've registered with RIPE
2. **User behavior patterns** - Where users of that IP typically connect from
3. **Device location signals** - Location data from devices using that IP address

When these sources conflict, Google often overrides the official location with what their algorithms determine to be more accurate, even when that determination is incorrect.

Unfortunately, this issue is beyond our control as Google manages their geolocation database independently.

## How to verify your server's actual location

You can confirm your server's true registered location using these tools:

- [Check Host](https://check-host.net) - Shows location from multiple testing points
- [IPinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io) - Provides detailed IP geolocation data
- [MaxMind](https://www.maxmind.com/en/geoip-demo) - Industry standard geolocation database
- [RIPE Database](https://apps.db.ripe.net/db-web-ui/query?bflag=false&dflag=false&rflag=true&searchtext=&source=RIPE) - The official source where we register our IP subnet locations

RIPE is the most authoritative source, since that's where we officially report our IP subnet locations.

## Report the issue to Google

You can help by reporting incorrect IP geolocation to Google:

1. Visit the [Google Search Help feedback form](https://support.google.com/websearch/workflow/9308722?hl=en)
2. Select your server's actual country (Germany) from the dropdown
3. Enter your server's IP address in the appropriate field
4. Submit the form

Please note that Google maintains complete control over their geolocation data and may not implement changes immediately. They might even reject corrections if their algorithms suggest a different location.

## Our solution options

In some cases, we can offer a one-time IP address replacement free of charge. While this is more of a band-aid solution, and does not solve the problem entirely, it might resolve the issue temporarily.

We have already contacted Google about this problem and are awaiting a response. However, since this is ultimately controlled by Google's systems, we cannot guarantee a full-on solution to this problem.

We are pleased to announce that on April 24, 2025, Google has completely updated their geolocation data for all our subnets, including IPv6! All your servers will now correctly display in their true location.

We thank all our customers for their patience and support in resolving this issue.
