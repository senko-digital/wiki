# Low Speed When Using AmneziaWG

## Why AmneziaWG May Be Slower Than Regular WireGuard

AmneziaWG is a modern version of the popular WireGuard VPN protocol. It is a fork of WireGuard that offers protection against Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) systems while maintaining the simplified architecture and high performance of the original protocol.

### AmneziaWG Features

The main feature of AmneziaWG is its ability to mask traffic as regular internet traffic. This is achieved through:

1. Modification of all packet headers:

- Initiator to Responder
- Responder to Initiator
- Data packets
- Special "Under Load" packets

2. Changes to authentication packet sizes:

- Adding random bytes to each authentication packet
- Modifying handshake packet sizes using S1 and S2 parameters

3. Additional masking:

- Sending "junk" packets before session start
- Configurable parameters for the number and size of these packets (Jc, Jmin, Jmax)

### Reasons for Speed Reduction

The speed reduction when using AmneziaWG compared to regular WireGuard is due to several factors:

1. **Additional packet processing**: Each packet requires additional processing for traffic masking, which increases latency.

2. **Increased packet size**: Adding "junk" data and header modification increases the size of transmitted packets.

3. **Routing complexity**: Unique headers for each user create additional load on the network infrastructure.

4. **Network infrastructure features**: Modern networks use complex routing and traffic processing systems that may react differently to non-standard protocols. This can lead to additional delays in data transmission.

### Why the Problem Cannot Be Resolved

At the current moment, it is impossible to completely eliminate the speed reduction for the following reasons:

1. **Security vs. speed trade-off**: The main function of AmneziaWG is protection against DPI system detection, which requires additional traffic processing.

2. **Technical limitations**: Protocol modification for traffic masking inevitably introduces additional delays.

3. **Network infrastructure**: Protocol features may conflict with some network settings and protection systems.

### Optimization Recommendations

While it's impossible to completely eliminate the speed reduction, you can take the following steps to improve performance:

1. Use servers with minimal latency
2. Optimize network settings
3. Optimize VPN settings (MTU, packet sizes, and other settings)
4. Choose a server with higher bandwidth
5. Use a stable internet connection

### Conclusion

AmneziaWG offers a unique balance between security and performance. While it may be slower than regular WireGuard, this is a consequence of its main function - protection against detection. At the current moment, it is impossible to completely eliminate this speed reduction.
