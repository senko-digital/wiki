# ❓ Getting Started with the Game Control Panel

Quick instructions for new users of the game control panel.

## What is the Game Control Panel For?

The **Senko Digital** hosting game control panel provides our users with a streamlined and convenient solution for managing their game servers, without the need for special technical knowledge.

## Who Developed the Panel?

We based our panel on the open-source [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io) project, which is why our control panel has so many similarities with the original control panel.

We continually add new functionality and design elements to the control panel to ensure the easiest and most convenient user experience.
