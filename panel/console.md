# ðŸ’» Console

Quick guide to using the server console in the game control panel.

## Page Description

When you enter the server control console, the first thing you'll see is:

![server console](/images/panel/console.png){data-zoomable}

This is the main page inside your server management.

It displays various information about your server, such as IP address and port; CPU, RAM, and network load; total received/sent traffic; and the server console window itself.

## Sending Commands

Sending a command to the server is a very simple process. Just left-click on the input field, enter the desired command, and press the `[Enter]` key.
