# ðŸ“– Logs

Brief description of the logs (activity journal) page in the game control panel.

## Page Description

With this page, you can view recent actions performed on the server, whether by you or other users, as well as track the IP addresses from which the request was made (which can be very useful for avoiding unpleasant situations in case of account hacking).

The activity log displays almost all actions performed on the server: whether it's starting the server, viewing or editing a file, uploading files via SFTP, or even a complete server reinstallation.
