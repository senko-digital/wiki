Quick guide for configuring the `server.cfg` file of a Garry's Mod game server.

***

By default, each Garry's Mod server hosted on our hosting comes with this `server.cfg`:

::: code-group

```js:line-numbers [server.cfg]
// Server name in-game
hostname "New Garrys Mod Server / Hosted by senko.digital"
// Server password
sv_password ""
// Loading screen
sv_loadingurl "https://senko.media/digital/gmod/loading.html"
// Server listing display settings
sv_location "de"
sv_region "255"
sv_lan "0"
sv_max_queries_sec_global "30000"
sv_max_queries_window "45"
sv_max_queries_sec "5"
// Server limits
sbox_maxprops "10"
sbox_maxragdolls "0"
sbox_maxnpcs "0"
sbox_maxballoons "0"
sbox_maxeffects "0"
sbox_maxdynamite "0"
sbox_maxlamps "0"
sbox_maxthrusters "0"
sbox_maxwheels "0"
sbox_maxhoverballs "0"
sbox_maxvehicles "0"
sbox_maxbuttons "0"
sbox_maxsents "0"
sbox_maxemitters "0"
sbox_godmode "0"
sbox_noclip "0"
// Network settings - please leave them at default
sv_minrate 120000
sv_maxrate 0
gmod_physiterations 2
net_splitpacket_maxrate 45000
decalfrequency 12
sv_parallel_sendsnapshot 1
sv_parallel_packentities 1
// Player ban command execution - please do not edit these lines
exec banned_ip.cfg
exec banned_user.cfg
// Add all your parameters below this line
```

It contains quite a large number of parameters, but not many people know what they mean and what they are needed for.

In this article, we will analyze each parameter and explain what changes they make to your server.
