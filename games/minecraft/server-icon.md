# <MinecraftLogo>Changing Server Icon</MinecraftLogo>

Quick guide for changing the server icon in the game control panel.

***

By default, Minecraft servers have a somewhat depressing, black and white picture that clearly doesn't suit your wonderful server. Let's fix that!

![old server icon](/images/games/minecraft/server-icon/old.png){data-zoomable}

First, choose your preferred image for your server's logo. Reduce its size to 64x64, convert it to .png format, and save it as `server-icon.png`.

Now go to the management of the server you need.

Enter the file manager.

Upload the icon to the root folder.

Restart the server, and voilà, your server should now have an icon. Isn't that better? :wink:

![new server icon](/images/games/minecraft/server-icon/new.png){data-zoomable}
