# <MinecraftLogo>Changing Server Icon</MinecraftLogo>

Quick guide for changing the server icon in the game control panel.

***

By default, Minecraft servers have a somewhat depressing, black and white picture that clearly doesn't suit your wonderful server. Let's fix that!

![old server icon](/images/games/minecraft/server-icon/old.png){data-zoomable}

First, choose your preferred image for your server's logo. Reduce its size to 64x64, convert it to .png format, and save it as `server-icon.png`.

Now go to the management of the server you need.

Enter the file manager.

Upload the icon to the root folder.

Restart the server, and voil√†, your server should now have an icon. Isn't that better? :wink:

![new server icon](/images/games/minecraft/server-icon/new.png){data-zoomable}
