# ðŸ“© Sending Commands

With the bot, you can send commands to your server from the game control panel.

To use this command, you must first [authorize with the Discord bot](/bot/auth).

To use the command, simply follow the syntax we've provided and everything will work.

Example usage:

```lua
/send-command server_id: 64710835 command: start
```
