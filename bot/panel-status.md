# üîÅ Server Status from Panel

With the bot, you can also view the status of your servers from the control panel.

To use this command, you need to be [authorized with an API key from the control panel](/bot/auth).

You can use the `/servers-list` command to display a list of servers with their IDs and status.

::: tip
Please note that even if a server is shown as running, this does not guarantee that it is actually working. For a complete server status check, it is recommended to use [**[üîÅ Any Server Status](/bot/any-status)**].
:::

This command is also very useful if you have several servers in the control panel and need to manage power or send commands to a specific server.
