# How to Choose a Reliable Hosting Provider

Choosing the right hosting provider is one of the key factors in your project's success. Making the wrong decision can lead to downtime, data loss, and even loss of customers. In this article, we'll look at the main criteria you should consider when choosing a hosting provider.

## Key Selection Criteria

### 1. Stability and Uptime

**What to look for:**

- Guaranteed availability level (SLA) — should be at least 99.2%
- Downtime history — it's worth checking reviews about service stability
- Transparency in reporting — a good provider openly communicates about any problems that arise

::: tip
99.2% stability means no more than 6 hours of downtime per month. Every minute can mean loss of your nerves, money, and most importantly - your customers.
:::

### 2. Hardware Specifications

**Key parameters:**

- **Processors** — modern CPUs (AMD Ryzen/Epyc, Intel Core 10th generation and above) provide better performance
- **Memory** — DDR4/DDR5 with sufficient capacity for your needs
- **Storage** — NVMe SSDs are significantly faster than regular SSDs and especially HDDs
- **Network** — bandwidth and DDoS attack protection

### 3. Technical Support

Good support is not just a quick response, but also qualified assistance in resolving any questions or problems.

**Pay attention to:**

- Response time and support hours (24/7 or limited hours)
- Communication channels (tickets, chat, phone, messengers)
- Knowledge and experience of support specialists
- Availability of support in your language (if that's important to you)

### 4. Server Locations

The location of data centers affects the speed of access to your project:

- For projects targeting a European audience, locations in Eastern or Western Europe are optimal
- For international projects — strategically located data centers or CDN
- Also consider the legal aspects of data storage in certain countries, especially in the EU

### 5. Scalability

The ability to quickly increase resources is important for growing projects:

- Ease of changing plans without server reinstallation
- Ability to quickly add resources during peak load periods
- No lengthy downtime during upgrades

### 6. DDoS Protection

DDoS attacks are becoming more common, so it's important to have:

- Basic protection at L3/L4 level
- Advanced L7 protection options for critical projects (can also be achieved through third party providers)
- Transparency in explaining protection mechanisms

::: warning
Lack of DDoS protection can lead to complete unavailability of your project even under relatively small attacks.
:::

### 7. Transparent Pricing

Always pay attention to:

- Clear pricing without hidden fees
- Option to pay for a longer term with a discount
- Fair refund policy
- Price-to-quality ratio

## Most Common Mistakes When Choosing Hosting

1. **Choosing based on price alone** — cheap hosting often turns out to be the most expensive mistake in the long run due to constant downtime and problems
2. **Ignoring reviews** — opinions of real customers provide valuable information about the quality of services provided by the host
3. **Not knowing the terms of use** — important limitations or conditions may be written in the company's documents
4. **Neglecting DDoS protection** — the modern internet requires at least minimal protection to ensure stable operation of your project

## Verifying Provider Reliability

Before choosing, it's worth:

1. **Studying reviews** on independent platforms and forums
2. **Checking the company's history** — how long they've been in the market, their reputation
3. **Evaluating documentation and knowledge base** — quality documentation speaks to the professionalism of the Company ;)
4. **Testing the quality of technical support** — ask a question before payment and assess the quality and response time
5. **Renting a server for a minimum period** — check the quality of services provided by the host, whether they suit your needs

## Conclusion

Choosing a reliable hosting provider is an investment in the future stability and development of your project.

It's worth spending time on a thorough analysis of available options in the market and choosing a solution that provides the optimal balance of price, quality, and reliability.
