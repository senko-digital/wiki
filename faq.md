# ü§î Frequently asked questions

## ü§î Which plan should I choose for my game server?

### Garry's Mod

Since Garry's Mod was built on the Source Engine, most CPU operations run on just one core.

We strongly recommend using plans with the highest single-core performance, namely **i9-12900K** or **i9-14900K**.

For a development server, the `i9-9900K 1 vCore / 2 GB DDR4 / 30 GB NVMe` plan would be ideal - its power will be more than sufficient for hosting a test server.

For a medium-load server (with 30-40 online players), the `R9-7950X 1 vCore / 4 GB DDR4 / 50 GB NVMe` plan would be suitable.

For a high-load server (with over 50 online players), it is strongly recommended to choose at least the `i9-14900K 1 vCore / 4 GB DDR4 / 60 GB NVMe` plan.

### Minecraft

Minecraft, unlike Garry's Mod, actively utilizes multi-threading - especially if the server is configured for large worlds with many plugins or mods. Therefore, it's important to choose plans that offer the highest number of cores and RAM.

We recommend using plans with processors that provide high per-core performance and a significant number of threads, such as **i9-12900K** or **Ryzen 9 7950X**.

For small servers with a limited number of players and basic configuration, the `i9-9900K 2 vCore / 8 GB DDR4 / 200 GB NVMe` plan is an excellent choice.

If you need support for a large number of players or complex modifications, consider the `Ryzen 9 7950X 4 vCore / 16 GB DDR5 / 200 GB NVMe` plan or higher.

## üåê Where are your servers located?

Our servers are currently located in one main location: **Germany**, **Frankfurt**. We plan to expand in the future, so stay tuned for updates.

## üõ°Ô∏è Do you offer any DDos protection?

In Germany, we currently provide basic L4 DDoS protection **only**.

## üíµ What payment methods are available?

We accept payments from cards worldwide, including cards issued in the **European Union**, **Ukraine** and **Russia**. Payment is also possible through **PayPal**, **YooMoney wallets**, and cryptocurrencies **USDT**/**TON**/**BTC**/**LTC**.

## üïí How long does server setup take?

Virtual servers are set up within 120 seconds after payment.

For game servers, processing often takes just 15 minutes after payment.
Please note that timelines can always extend up to 48 hours due to the lack of available slots and/or IP addresses.

If your order is being processed for more than 48 hours, you will be given the opportunity to request a full refund for the service or receive compensation in the form of additional days of server operation.

## üõí How do I order a service?

Detailed instructions for ordering a service are [available in this article](/personal-area/vps-order).

## üíª How do I access the game control panel?

The control panel is [available here](https://panel.senko.digital/auth/login).

To log in, you need to use the email address you provided when registering in your personal account, as well as the password you set yourself when initially ordering the server (or have already used in the control panel).

## üìä Can I change my plan after purchase?

Yes, you can always upgrade your server plan to a more powerful one within the same line of plans. Plan changes are applied within a couple of minutes and do not require server reinstallation.
