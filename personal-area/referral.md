# Referral Program

Senko Digital offers you the opportunity to earn by referring clients. You receive **5% from each of their orders**, and this payment remains yours forever.

## How it works?

- **Get your referral link** in your [personal account](https://my.senko.digital/billmgr?clickstat=yes&startform=affiliate.client).  
- **Share the link** — place it on your website, social media, and forums.  
- **The client registers** via your link or enters your promo code when ordering.  
- **You receive 5% from their payments** — without time or amount limitations.  

If a client registers without using your link, they can still enter your promo code during their first order, and the system will assign them to you.

## Where to track your income?

- In the **"Income"** section, you can view earnings from orders.  
- In the **"Statistics"** section, you can see a list of all referred clients.  

## Payouts and limitations

- **Minimum withdrawal amount** – 50€.  
- **Available payout methods**: cryptocurrency, bank cards, PayPal.  
- **Self-referrals, spam, and client deception are prohibited**.  

The program operates without hidden conditions — your share remains yours as long as the client stays active.

## Start earning

Simply copy the link, share it, and receive income from each order.
